# lscom

a crude python script that lists available active com ports on your workstation. this should work cross platform, but has not been extensively tested. 

this is useful if you plug in a console cable and you want to quickly identify which COM port is now available. however, if the COM port is being used by sometihng, it will not show in the output.
